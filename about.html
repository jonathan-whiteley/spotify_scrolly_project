            <h3>We built this visualization tool in order to help music fans like us explore how the COVID-19 Pandemic had altered our taste in music, if at all. When we started this project, we were curious to understand shifts in global listening preferences. Over the past two years, we noticed that feelings of stress and yearning brought on by health concerns, remote work, relocation, and isolation found their ways into many aspects of our lives. One aspect in particular was the shifts in our musical tastes.

            <h3>More experimentation with different genres, returning to old classics, and turning to more relaxing, ambient music were changes we noticed in our own listening habits. We were eager to understand if this pattern was common, and curious in what other ways the pandemic might have changed global music preferences. After researching the question, we found that there had been little done to explore these questions with existing visualizations, so we built our own! </h3>

            <h3>In order to build this site, we relied on data publicly available through Spotify's APIs. Spotify has the highest number of monthly active users across all distributed service providers in the music industry. Our song universe was scraped from the Global Top 200 charts, by day and by country for the last four years. In order to accomplish the below tasks, we incorporated a temporal component into each visualization so that users can compare trends before and after/during the pandemic. </h3>
